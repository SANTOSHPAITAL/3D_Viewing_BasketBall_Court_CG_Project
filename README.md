Software Requirements:
Operating System : Windows
IDE : VS Express
Coding Language : C++

Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts of 3D Viewing of Basketball Court in OpenGL. This mini project aims to develop a computer graphics application using OpenGL to create a 3D view of a Basketball court with a ball. The project focuses on rendering a realistic representation of a Basketball court and simulating the movement of a 3D ball within the court. The implementation involves the use of OpenGL's graphics pipeline, geometric transformations, shading, and texturing techniques to achieve the desired visual effects. We have used input devices like mouse and key board to interact with program. To differentiate between objects we have used different colors for different objects. The project begins with the setup of the OpenGL development environment, ensuring the availability of the necessary libraries and tools. A window is created, and the graphics context is initialized for rendering the 3D scene. Camera controls are implemented to allow the user to navigate and view the 3D scene from different perspectives. Transformations are applied to move, rotate, and zoom the camera, giving the user a sense of control and interactivity. Lighting effects play a crucial role in enhancing the visual quality of the scene. Basic lighting models, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, are applied to illuminate the Basketball court. These lighting techniques add depth and realism to the scene, highlighting the contours of the court and the ball.
